CityCamp Minnesota will launch our first unconference on Saturday, November 12, 2011 in Minneapolis with the broad theme of "Community 2.0." From great people in government, community organizations, and technology start-ups to "everyday citizens" who happen to be software developers, social media experts, open government advocates, and students, everyone is welcome. 
*   *In a world of scarce public resources, how do we take advantage of the "2.0" online, social media, and open source world to help build awesome local communities? *
*   **How can we connect the interested public with 2.0 skills to work with government, community groups, neighborhood associations, local ethnic associations, and more? **
*   *How can our local communities be bold, inclusive, open, accessible, wired and darn right innovative when bottom-up connects with top-down for collaboration?*
*   *Learn more about [other CityCamps][1] and gathering in [cities around the world][2].*

## **The Conversations Starts with You.**

*   **[Register now.][3]** Space is limited.
*   ***We just released the final batch of 50 tickets! Sign up as a general attendee or select a specific ticket if you fit the category [here][4].*** Thanks to our sponsors and volunteers, the event is free! We will start with coffee and pastries at 8 a.m. at the Humphrey Center, at the University of Minnesota on the West Bank on Saturday, November 12th.  Our "you just gotta be there" opening session begins at 9:00 a.m. sharp. We will close up officially at 3 p.m. and pick a near by pub for an informal happy hour or five. 

*   **[Submit/vote on session ideas][5]** Share this event on Twitter using the 

[#citycampmn hashtag][6], on Facebook, and via e-mail with others. 
## **What is an "unconference?" ** Simple. 

*The coffee break becomes the conference.* 
1.  You introduce yourself at the beginning with your name, organization (if one), and three words.
2.  [Via the web now][7] and that morning you can [say what you want to discover or what your are inspired to share][7] related to the Community 2.0 theme.
3.  Some magic happens.
4.  And the day is filled with at least 25 different very interactive small and large break-out discussions (~5 to 25 people).
5.  From time to time we report summaries back to the full group and lots of the content is recorded, tweeted, and shared to all.
