Before you come, preview the [participant introductions][1] or scan the [public version of the attendee list (scroll down)][2] to start the networking. Tweet that you are on your way or will be attending with the [hashtag #CityCampMN][3]. Dress casual. Then [get parked and then get inside the Humphrey Center][4] on the West Bank of the University of Minnesota. Coffee will be out at 8:00 a.m. when registration opens. We will start at 9:00 a.m. sharp. [Humphrey School Social Media course][5] students will have a blue sticker on their name tags if you have any questions during the day. Fill out session idea cards (with something you'd like to share OR learn - [video example][6]) in the Atrium. Those who want to "lead" a session may also briefly promote their idea during the morning on stage. (Similar ideas are then combined and crafted into the full session grid off stage.)
