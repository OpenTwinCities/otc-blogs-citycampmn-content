We are excited to promote the [OpenTwinCities.org][1] effort. OpenTwinCities is a place for software developers interested in developing and creating local instances of civic technology apps in the Twin Cities to roll up their sleeves and make things happen. On a related note, E-Democracy.org is exploring opportunities to raise the support required for the next CityCamp in Minnesota in 2013. This dynamic event combines geeks, wonks, and citizens interested in open government, open communities, and civic tech in an exciting "unconference" format. Join the [planning committee online group][2] to get involved. Â
