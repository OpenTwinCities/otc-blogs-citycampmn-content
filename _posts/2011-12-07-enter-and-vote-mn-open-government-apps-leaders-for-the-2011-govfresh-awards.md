So much is happening in the civic technology community - website redesigns, new websites, open data initiatives, apps, camps, developer contests, hackathons and more - it's hard to get a perspective on or truly appreciate the collective work of these dot-dogooders both inside and outside government. That's why we created the [2011 GovFresh Awards][1]. It's time to recognize and honor all that's been accomplished this year. It's time to say thank you. Here are the categories.
